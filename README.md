# Practical Unit Testing With Junit and Mockito ðŸŽ“

This repo contatins solved exercises from the book ["Practical Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito"](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Unit-Testing-JUnit-Mockito/dp/8393489393)

The goal of reading the book is learning:
* [Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) -  is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.
* [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) -  is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development, and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks which is collectively known as xUnit that originated with SUnit.
* [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) - is an open source testing framework for Java released under the MIT License. The framework allows the creation of test double objects (mock objects) in automated unit tests for the purpose of test-driven development (TDD) or behavior-driven development (BDD).
